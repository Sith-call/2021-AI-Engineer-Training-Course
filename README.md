## Darknet & Yolov4

Darknet : Neural networks framework

Yolov4 : Object dection algorithm

labelImg : Data labeling tool

Dataset : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/choemarco/mouse-book)

Weights : [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jy4jGshzCzajSByDK6k0YIDVVXi-z3lt/view?usp=sharing)

## Data processing and aggregation by python

I can make names of image file and labeling file in different directories uniform by python.(data_aggregation.py)

I resized images and made dataset bigger by using opencv-python.(data_process.py)

## Review

I learned an overview of AI.

I implemented a small neural network by python myself.

I did object detection using MS COCO dataset with Yolov4 and Darkent.

I got an insight of Deep Learning dataset by making custom dataset.

I used Colab Pro for training  CNN.
